**Tutor Quality Scoring System** Create an automated system that evaluates tutor performance across every session, identifies coaching opportunities, predicts which tutors will churn, and recommends interventions. The system must process 3,000 daily sessions and provide actionable insights within 1 hour of session completion. 

● Retention Enhancement Requirements: 

○ Detect patterns leading to poor first session experiences (24% of churners fail here) 

○ Flag tutors with high rescheduling rates (98.2% of reschedules are tutor-initiated) 

○ Identify tutors at risk of no-shows (16% of tutor replacements due to no-shows) 


● Cost analysis for production deployment 

**Success Metrics:** 

● Does it solve a real business problem? 

● Could this ship to production within 2 weeks? 

● Does it leverage AI in sophisticated ways? 

● Clear path to ROI within 90 days?
